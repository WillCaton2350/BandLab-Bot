{UPCOMMING}

Bot Features:
- Repost
- Follow 
- Unfollow
- Like 
- Comment 


{$Issues}
- Each selenium bot .py file is a microservice
 + (More like a modular monolithic approach)

- Still not handling the popup interaction if the popup element isn't showing on the screen.
 + Address / change project structure and file names.
 + (For you) feed separate folder from (original following feed).
 + For you and following page for the like and comment bot. 
  * (The Follow account bot works within a single/separate tab and is not tied to the follwing feed or the for you page feed)

{Increase Counter}
 + Increase the follow account feature past 4
 + Increase the like post feature past 10
 + Increase the comment on post feature past 10
 + Increase the unfollow account feature past 7
 + Increase the repost feature past 1

Bot file naming convention order:
 - Component = like bot 
 - Accounts = follow bot 
 - Rehash = repost bot 
 - Service = comment bot 

- The unfollow bot is giving me issues. 
 Firefox webdriver cannot locate the 
 'following' a tag with the click() function.
 + Fixed. Now unfollows 7 accounts at a time

The DM Bot works but I am getting an invalid chat error message on the client side. 
 - (So this is an issue with bandlab not with my python selenium bot.)
